Answers must be written within the answer boxes provided. Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer with no working. Answers must be supported by working and/or explanations. Solutions found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by suitable working. For example, if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may be given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working. \linebreak You are therefore advised to show all working.

\question A king rules a small mountain kingdom, which is in the form of a square of length $4$ kilometres. The square is described by the co-ordinate system $0≤x≤4$, $0≤y≤4$.

The king has four adult children, each of which has a luxury palace located at the points $(1,1)$, $(3,1)$, $(1,3)$, $(3,3)$. Each child owns all the land that is nearer their palace than any other palace.

    \insertframedimage[width=0.4\textwidth]{fig/example-pic3}
    
    \expl{ The king has a fifth (youngest) child who is now just growing up. He installs her in a new palace situated at point $(2,2)$. The rule about ownership of land is then reapplied. }
    
    \part[2] Draw a new Voronoi diagram in the grid below to represent this new situation. \droppoints
