    \item Write your name in the box above.
    \item Do not open this examination paper until instructed to do so.
    \item A graphic display calculator is required for this paper.
    \item Answer all questions.
    \item Answers must be written within the answer boxes provided.
    \item Unless otherwise stated in the question, all numerical answers should be given exactly or correct to three significant figures.
    \item A clean copy of the \textbf{mathematics: applications and interpretation formula booklet} is required for this paper.

Answers must be written within the answer boxes provided. Full marks are not necessarily awarded for~a~correct answer with no working. Answers must be supported by working and/or explanations. Solutions found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by suitable working. For example, if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer. Where an answer is~incorrect, some marks may be given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working. You~are therefore advised to show all working.

% questions start here

% by default, \question prints the total points on the first line.
% hence, all points for the question itself (not its parts) should be added with \points*, not \points
\question George goes fishing. From experience he knows that the mean number of fish he catches per hour is $1.1$. It is assumed that the number of fish he catches can be modelled by a Poisson distribution. 

On a day in which George spends $8$ hours fishing, find the probability that he will catch more than $9$ fish. \points*{4}

% $T$ is an italic T. Use an upright T with $\T$ (defined on line 15).
\question The Voronoi diagram below shows three identical cellular phone towers, $\T1$, $\T2$ and $\T3$. A fourth cellular phone tower, $\T4$ is located in the shaded region. The dashed lines in the diagram below represent the edges in the Voronoi diagram.

% \SI and \num are convenient macros for scientific notation (from package siunitx)
% for example, \SI{3e8}{\m\per\s} gives $3\times 10^{8} m s^{-1}$ and 
% \num{1.2e-14} gives $1.2\times 10^{-14}$.

\question Charlie and Daniella each began a fitness programme. On day one, they both ran \SI{500}{\m}. On each subsequent day, Charlie ran \SI{100}{\m} more than the previous day whereas Daniella increased her distance by \SI{2}{\percent} of the distance ran on the previous day.
