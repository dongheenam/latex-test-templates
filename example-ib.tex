Answers must be written within the answer boxes provided. Full marks are not necessarily awarded for~a~correct answer with no working. Answers must be supported by working and/or explanations. Solutions found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by suitable working. For example, if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer. Where an answer is~incorrect, some marks may be given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working. You~are therefore advised to show all working.

\begin{questions}
\question George goes fishing. From experience he knows that the mean number of fish he catches per hour is $1.1$. It is assumed that the number of fish he catches can be modelled by a Poisson distribution. 

On a day in which George spends $8$ hours fishing, find the probability that he will catch more than $9$ fish. \points*{4}

\question The Voronoi diagram below shows three identical cellular phone towers, $\T1$, $\T2$ and $\T3$. A fourth cellular phone tower, $\T4$ is located in the shaded region. The dashed lines in the diagram below represent the edges in the Voronoi diagram.

Horizontal scale: $1$ unit represents $\SI{1}{\km}$. \linebreak
Vertical scale: $1$ unit represents $\SI{1}{\km}$.

Tim stands inside the shaded region. \points{2}
\begin{parts}
    \part Explain why Tim will receive the strongest signal from tower $\T4$. \points{1}
\end{parts}
Tower $\T2$ has coordinates $(âˆ’9 , 5)$ and the edge connecting vertices $\A$ and $\B$ has equation $y = 3$.
\begin{parts}[resume]
    \part Write down the coordinates of tower $\T4$. \points{2}
\end{parts}
Tower $\T1$ has coordinates $(-13,3)$.
\begin{parts}[resume]
    \part Find the gradient of the edge of the Voronoi diagram between towers $\T1$ and $\T2$. \points{3}

\question Charlie and Daniella each began a fitness programme. On day one, they both ran $\SI{500}{\m}$. On each subsequent day, Charlie ran $\SI{100}{\m}$ more than the previous day whereas Daniella increased her distance by $2\%$ of the distance ran on the previous day.

\begin{parts}
    \part Calculate how far
    \begin{subparts}
        \subpart Charlie ran on day $20$ of his fitness programme.
        \subpart Daniella ran on day $20$ of her fitness programme. \points{5}
    \end{subparts}
\end{parts}

On day $n$ of the fitness programmes Daniella runs more than Charlie for the first time.
